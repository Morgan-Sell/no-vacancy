# ============================
# airflow.txt (Airflow-only deps)
# ----------------------------
# Installs Apache Airflow using its official constraints file
# to pin a known-good dependency set.
#
# WHY SEPARATED?
# - Airflow manages ~100 dependencies with strict version pins
#   (Flask, Jinja2, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Pendulum, etc.)
# - Mixing those into the app/dev requirements can easily cause
#   resolver conflicts with your FastAPI/ML stack.
# - By isolating Airflow here, we:
#     * Keep app images smaller (they don’t carry Airflow unless needed)
#     * Speed up CI jobs that don’t touch DAGs
#     * Avoid dependency conflicts by letting Airflow’s constraints
#       lock its own ecosystem cleanly
#
# Install this ONLY in jobs/containers that need Airflow or DAG parsing.
